# Now Do This
The most minimalistic todo list. Sometimes you might get overwhelmed by focusing on or thinking about too many things at the same time. In this case it might be helpful to write down the most essential tasks and make them visible only one at a time.

 This project is inspired by [nowdothis.com](https://nowdothis.com). There seems to be some bug on that page that makes it unusable, so I decided to recreate it myself as I find it extremely useful.
